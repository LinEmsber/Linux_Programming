/*
 * When the shell receives SIGHUP, it in turn sends SIGHUP to the jobs it has created.
 *
 * The main task of this program is to create a child process, and then have both the
 * parent and the child pause to catch SIGHUP and display a message if it is received.
 * If the program is given an optional command-line argument (which may be any string),
 * the child places itself in a different process group (within the same session).
 *
 * This is useful to show that the shell doesnâ€™t send SIGHUP to a process group that
 * it did not create, even if it is in the same session as the shell.
