                        Interrupt request
===============================================================================

In a computer, an interrupt request (or IRQ) is a hardware signal sent to the processor that
temporarily stops a running program and allows a special program, an interrupt handler, to run
instead. Hardware interrupts are used to handle events such as receiving data from a modem or
network card, key presses, or mouse movements.


Overview:
When working with personal computer hardware, installing and removing devices, the system
relies on interrupt requests. There are default settings that are configured in the system
BIOS and recognized by the operating system. These default settings can be altered by
advanced users. Modern plug and play technology has not only reduced the need for concern
for these settings, but has also virtually eliminated manual configuration.
